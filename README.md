## Logo

The original logo was designed by PabloDons, who provides some insight on the design process:
> I don’t remember what triggered it, but we decided one day that we need a new theme for our (at the time) mybb forum.
Back when I was but a wee lad still in highschool, and somehow rocking a bottomless confidence for anything technology I basically just cheated, stole some theme off the internet and messed with the colors till they looked sorta OREy.
I was really into it and went for a logo as well to top it all off.
True genius really just comes out of the blue and without your consent I guess, but I had this vision of wires all wiggly and random, so I drew some lines on a grid that resembled the letters and just kept adding wires.
I searched “vector drawing software” and pulled up inkscape and brought it into reality.
This was supposed to be the header on the mybb forum, but also a website favicon needed to match, so I was on that as well.
I had the focus of Nickster discovering trains for the first time and probably drew almost a hundred designs before Decapo pointed one out and screamed his heart out about it in a slack chat.
Back to inkscape.
Exported and dropped into a favicon generator.
I still have the damn notebook I violated with a red marker.
A true beauty.

### Primary Logo

There is also a square version with a shadow used for Discord and other platforms that benefit from the square aspect ratio:
